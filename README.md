# sample-data-query
This project uses a sample dataset and runs a simple query to find desired data. Results are then automatically saved in a new spreadsheet. You can use this script to play around with and run any query you would like with the sample dataset.

Note: In order to use this script, you must first install the Pandas python library. The sample dataset is also included in the files.
